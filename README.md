## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
Authentication is simulated with mock data. In a production environment, this would connect to a secure authentication service.

### Data Persistence
All data is stored in memory and will reset on page refresh. A production version would integrate with backend APIs for persistent storage.

### Responsive Design
The UI is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
